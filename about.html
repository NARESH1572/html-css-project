        <h2>The Name</h2>
        <p>The Olympia Oyster (Ostrea Lurida) is our “namesake oyster”. It is the only native oyster to the West Coast. It nearly became extinct due to over harvesting and ocean pollution and thus got overshadowed by the introduction of its Japanese distant cousin. Olympia Oyster Bar is an homage to the brilliant and valiant little bi-valve that has slowly made a comeback thanks to hard working oyster farmers.</p>

        <h2>The Oysters</h2>
        <p>We proudly source our oysters directly from highly sustainable family-owned farms. Call it ‘Farm-to-Bar’ oysters.</p>

        <h2>The Wines</h2>
        <p>
            Oysters and wine are made to be together: combined they create an experience far greater than the sum of its parts.  Much like oysters, wine is also highly susceptible to nature’s variations: terroir. We strongly believe that within their craft both oyster farmer and vintners best express the sense of place of their chosen good by paying a close eye to nature itself.</p>
